This code performs data exploration, correlation analysis, and linear regression modeling on a taxi dataset, aiming to understand and predict the total_amount of each ride. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps:

Data Loading and Overview: Loads the dataset and displays data information and summary statistics for a comprehensive overview of each column.

Scatter Plots: Generates scatter plots to visualize the relationship between total_amount (target variable) and key numeric features: trip_distance, fare_amount, tip_amount, tolls_amount, and trip_duration.

Correlation Analysis: Calculates the correlation matrix, showing relationships among numeric variables. The heatmap highlights how strongly each feature correlates with total_amount, aiding in feature selection.

Linear Regression Model: Prepares feature columns (trip_distance, fare_amount, tip_amount, tolls_amount, trip_duration) to predict total_amount. The model is then trained, and the intercept and coefficients are printed to understand the influence of each feature on the target.

Prediction and Visualization: Predicts total_amount using the model and generates a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted values, with a red diagonal line for reference. This plot helps assess model accuracy.

The code provides insights into feature relationships and leverages a linear regression model for predicting total_amount, offering valuable visual and statistical perspectives on the dataset.

Your code performs an analysis of an e-commerce dataset with encoding, data visualization, and logistic regression. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality and considerations:

Data Encoding:

Gender, Product_Category, and Device_Used columns are encoded numerically using LabelEncoder.
According to your encoding:
Gender: Male = 1, Female = 0
Product_Category: Books = 0, Electronics = 1, Clothing = 2
Device_Used: Tablet = 0, Desktop = 1, Mobile = 2
Data Visualization:

A scatter plot shows the distribution of Gender across Purchased.
sns.pairplot provides a comprehensive view of feature pair relationships.
A box plot for Age visualizes its distribution, which can help identify outliers.
A correlation heatmap shows how each feature relates to Purchased, highlighting potential predictors.
Logistic Regression:

The model is trained with logistic regression, predicting the probability of Purchased based on features: Age, Gender, Time_Spent, Product_Category, Number_of_Items_Viewed, and Device_Used.
accuracy_score calculates the model’s performance on the test set

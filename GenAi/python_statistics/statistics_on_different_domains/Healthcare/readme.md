Data Loading and Exploration:

The code loads the dataset, checks data types, basic statistics, and identifies missing values using .info(), .describe(), and .isnull().sum().
Replacing Zeros with Mean in Specific Columns:

The function replace_zeros_with_mean() replaces zero values in Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, and BMI columns with their respective column means (excluding zeros).
This step is important since zeros in these columns likely represent missing data, and replacing them with the mean helps maintain data quality.
Data Visualization:

A boxplot of Insulin values visualizes its distribution and any outliers.
A heatmap of the correlation matrix reveals relationships among features, which can guide feature selection.
Logistic Regression Model:

The code defines independent variables X and the target variable y (diabetes outcome).
The data is split into training and testing sets, with 80% for training and 20% for testing.
A logistic regression model is trained and tested, with accuracy calculated using accuracy_score.

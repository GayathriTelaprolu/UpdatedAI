 a detailed analysis of traffic volume data in relation to temperature, time, and other features. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main components, as well as some suggestions for refinement:

Key Components of the Code
Data Preprocessing:

Categorical columns (holiday and weather_main) are label-encoded.
date_time is parsed to extract day, month, year, and hour, while temperature values are converted from Kelvin to Celsius.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Scatter plot of traffic volume vs. temperature.
Box plot of temperature to understand its distribution.
Correlation analysis using a heatmap, focused on traffic_volume.
Linear Regression Model:

Linear regression is used to predict traffic_volume, with coefficients and intercept displayed for interpretation.
Scatter plot to compare actual vs. predicted traffic volume values.
Hourly Traffic Volume Plot:

Line plot of traffic_volume by hour to observe any hourly patterns in traffic.

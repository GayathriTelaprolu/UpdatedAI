This code processes a loan default dataset, visualizes correlations, and builds a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Data Loading and Summary:

The dataset Loan_default.csv is loaded, and info() and describe() functions display data type information and summary statistics.
It converts the Default column to numeric to ensure it’s in a format suitable for modeling.
Correlation Matrix:

A correlation matrix is computed using only numeric variables.
A heatmap visually represents correlations, providing insights into which features may be relevant for predicting Default.
Feature Selection and Data Splitting:

Selects key features (Age, Income, LoanAmount, CreditScore, MonthsEmployed, NumCreditLines) as predictors (X) and Default as the target (y).
Splits the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
Feature Scaling:

Standardizes the data using StandardScaler to enhance model performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
Logistic Regression Model:

A logistic regression model is instantiated with max_iter=200 to ensure convergence during training.
The model is trained on the scaled training set, and predictions are made on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Calculates the accuracy score by comparing predicted and actual values for Default, providing a measure of the model’s classification performance.
Additional Considerations:
Check for any null values in Default after converting it to numeric, as any non-numeric values would have been set to NaN.
You could add metrics like precision, recall, or the confusion matrix to understand model performance in more detail, particularly if the dataset is imbalanced.

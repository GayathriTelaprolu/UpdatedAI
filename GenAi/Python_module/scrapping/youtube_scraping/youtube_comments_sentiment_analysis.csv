Look closely at the expressions on the faces in the background when they zoom in on Trump .. In particular some of the older folks. I cant read minds but I'd have to suspect from the look on some of these people's faces that they'd like to leave but can't, as their stuck in the cameras view and it would look just awful If they exited. 45 mins is a long time to sit thru, about anything these days. 
Interesting this venue doesn't have the AC to keep everyone cool but they have a pretty rockin sound system ready to go.
 
Later on Trump proclaimed: ""Vote ! , Be sure to get out and Vote on January 5th ..""   ** WTF **

@TrollTrack-w6v,"In his closing performance at his ”Town Hall” in Pennsylvania, Donald's inner self may have been trying to tell us something. The Sarah Brightman song that he played and swayed to... ""Time To Say Goodbye"" was originally written as ""Conte Partiro"" and performed by Andrea Bocelli.

Sarah Brightman heard it and realized it was perfect for a commission she had to write and perform a song for the ""Farewell Boxing Championship Fight"" of the then undefeated champion Henri Maske against Virgil Hill in 1996. Maske lost that, his last fight to Hill. Then, in the true spirit of boxing (something Trump likes to talk about), spoke to the crowd and apologized for losing. Hill waited patiently for Maske to say his goodbyes to the crowd then both boxers hugged and Maske congratulated Hill as Hill was awarded the championship belt. Maske then quietly stepped back to let Hill have his moment for the crowd to cheer for him.

If Donald only practised what he likes to “preach” this would have been a much more civil campaign and both candidates would be seen in a positive historical light.

It’s worth considering, Donald, that ten years after this defeat Maske returned to the ring “inspired” by “watching his opponent’s many victories over the years.” Hill and Maske fought again and this time Maske won by a decision. That’s how it goes in real boxing, Donald, not everyone who asks for a rematch is a loser. That said, when they do lose, they accept it like the men they are, shake hands and return to fight another day.",0.24076704545454544,0.4132575757575757

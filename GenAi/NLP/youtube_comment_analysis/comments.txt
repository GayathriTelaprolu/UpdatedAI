1. It's a MAGA world after all.
2. CNN.    LMFAO.
3. CNN sure has an opinion on everything even though no-one sought it .
4. Elon Musk wants to get away with it. ELON MUSK IS NOT AMERICAN, HE WAS NOT BORN IN USA. so HE HATES AMERICA.
5. Trump has all these stray dogs and robot dogs. A real dog would not give Trump loyalty. His dogs have A.L. Artificial Loyalty.
6. Elon Musk can’t cut anything. His agency can only make recommendations.
7. We are literally pawns for 2 rich entitled man child's. That have NEVER walked in average Americans  shoes. Buckle up
8. Who on this planet has Library shelf WALLPAPER? lol I'm sorry, it's distracting and tough to take this child seriously 😂😅😂

Also, for the analyst to accuse Elon of  "messing with the algorithm" is hysterical. It's been proven by multiple sources that Google "messed with the algorithm" and made search results biased towards the current leftist regim.

Thank God for Elon Musk for ensuring we the people can expect a future with our verbal freedoms intact.


Sad part is, these leftist-paid "analysts" will never thank him for his work, ensuring they can do their job UNSCRIPTED. That's IF they have the courage to do their job without prejudice.
9. kaMALA, "I'm going to fix the economy! (cackle cackle cackle)"
Proceeds to go $20M in debt after receiving $1B in campaign funds.
10. Just like a Latin American country same thing they are all friends of Trump
11. Elon basically bought himself a spot in government.. or his business did
12. Has Tampon Tim learned how to load his shotgun yet, or is he still fake hunting?
13. Medias are jealous bc Elon is beside president Trump everyday hahaha
14. chaos 2.0 started
15. CNN didn't condemn Joe Biden when he picked his carbinet based on gender,skin colour,gender identity and Obama pressure.
CNN hasn't condemned none of Biden's picks,despite their mishandling of the nation.
16. "Potentially"!!
17. 👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🥰🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍
18. Scary times indeed! When this hits home to those of you who voted to turn the White House into a clown car and you find you’re gonna struggle just like the rest of us don’t come crying to us, you voted for him!
19. cnn will turn to youtube coz no one is watching them anymore except people checking up on their lies on youtube lol
20. Yes your bias news has got us trump, your dumb greedy boss must be so excited to get his tax cuts but karma hey, lost of any serious viewerships. I really hate the way you report your trump loving segments, it’s so obviously embarrassingly bias and I stoped watching ages ago but I like mr farrow bc he has credibility and not sure what he’s doing on cnn.
21. She says she can't think of anybody who was a private citizen that would have had this much influence. How about the left-wing news organizations that lied and misrepresented what people said constantly
22. I’m just here to watch a bunch of imaginary scenarios and fear mongering 😂
23. What are you guys going to do if he only cuts excess money being wasted. Gets rid of hundreds of jobs where people don't do anything but make big money. And everything turns out better and they're able to pay down some of our countries bills. Funny how you didn't point out all the bad that was happening when the Democrats were in chargeI guess you wouldn't have a job if you couldn't make it sound like something bad will happen constantly. Your job is supposed to be report what you see not to be a cheerleader for one political side and try to make people hate the other.
24. CNN trying hard to be taken seriously.    No wonder this network is tanking.  #CNNPravda. #CancelTheView
25. CNN = 🤡
26. Love it. I hope Trump and his X-Men broke shit open and let the sunshine in. Btw, this guy looks like he wears women's underwear.
27. Where's all your bots at, CNN???
28. Love these dummycrats losing it😂😂😂😂Clown National News❤
29. So awful this reporting
30. Nope, I decided to stop watching her
31. Cnn is having a meltdown.
32. Employment is propping up the economy , now they want to go backwards. Mr musk should be locked in a room with all the people who lose their jobs because of his bright ideas. Reap the whirl wind brother.

34. Jack smith has already been sacked by DOJ, who else is investigating trump again?
35. Bye bye cnn
36. CNN is such a joke.
37. Wow, some of the commentators of comments are either bots, from Russia, or just simple negative people that have nothing better to do… maybe go back to Fox and continue griping….
38. Elon use to be a democrat until recently. now he is a target because he left their side lol
39. F YOU CNN GOOD BYE !!!!!
40. Thank you guys for your reporting facts and not fluff!

44. Dana Bash is a robot for the deep state.  Goodbye and good luck CNN.
45. Oh man, not Rowan, too. I guess i owe Woody Alan an apology.
46. the most useless news agency on earth  CNN philippines just closed down.
47. Is that a woman or a man?
48. YAWN…after 5 years of nothing but lies CNN is done
49. Wow I haven’t seen Frank Sinatras 🏳️‍🌈 son in a while. Remember when the establishment media was pushing this no talent really hard?
50. I simply cannot wait until they ban drug company adds on CNN. The propaganda wing of big pharma will finally be silenced. Goodbye and good luck to all.
51. sorry, keep thinking of this kid's amazing mother and that Frank Sinatra story...so I am distracted
52. CNN and hosts LIE so much it's laughable 😅😅😅😅😅
53. Trump won because of policies of Democrats. No racism was involved.  Also Trump said many times he will not touch my retirement social security check. I believe My Chosen President so much more than CNN. 😂😂
54. The landslide win of Trump showed that the American people aren't falling for CNN's BS anymore
55. Elon needs to buy cnn and boot these corrupt fake reporters
56. The Blue Line Veto is illegal!  But then, when did that ever stop Trump?
57. Gay's are cry
58. I have a question for you CNN, You were WRONG in 2016, and you were WRONG in 2024 , my question is: Why should we believe you, that this time your comments are RIGHT ??? Thank you for your answer ...
59. That is why he campaigned so hard for Trump. To save his corrupt a**
60. CNN loves this shit! They don’t warn Americans of the real threat Trump and a Trump 2nd term is to America, they both sides things! And now, shit is imploding America is in real trouble and CNN is like, ‘amazing while America burns everyone will want to watch and we will get the views’
61. Just keep doing what you are doing and please don't stop! 😂
62. Elon is a brave guy to get involved, the democrats are going to go after him for the rest of his life.
63. Yes, his influence cost him $160 million.
64. The deep state is working overtime to crap on everyone associated with Trump.  Keep it up.  No one buys the bs anymore.  Have you guys updated your resumes yet?
65. Dems have PDiddy crew , Trump has Elon Musk 😂 i hope Musk buys this fake news channel after CNN no longer gets kick backs from the Democrats once Musk exposes rhem .
66. It’s funny how they keep stating that Elon Musk has billions in government contracts like the means anything to him… He pay 40 billion for X and is projected to be the first trillionaire…
67. The government isn't run, it's now played...sadly.
68. Musk could cut out the middleman and buy CNN 😄
69. Yep. America ppl want the swamp drained. Goodbye lifelong politicians. Watch out senate and congress. Term limits incoming
70. Cannot wait to see Elon buys  out CNN !
71. Trump added 8 Trillion in Debt while campaigning to reduce the debt
Failed to build the wall
failed at two marriages
failed over 6 business and bankruptcies
Failed coup
Failed to steal secret documents
He's a spoiled brat who will leave everyone  else to clean up his mess
Failed Trump University
Stole from his own charity
Failed Casino
Failed airline
The only thing that hasn't failed are the invetments his father gave him
72. The truth is, Americans chose Donald Trump for a reason: to eliminate the old guard that has been pushing for endless wars. I've been alive for 34 years, and my country has been in conflict the entire time. Clearly, many of you didn’t pay attention during the election—Trump won both the popular and electoral votes. That’s a clear mandate. The war hawks and unelected officials in those three-letter agencies are out. We’re legally removing you from your positions. Anyone in the military who supported this woke agenda? You’re fired. If you tried to undermine Trump back in 2016, expect to be court-martialed. That’s happening. 

And let’s be real: Trump isn’t scaring anyone except those who should be worried. When unelected officials at the Pentagon are scheming to override Trump’s authority in 2024, it just shows that what he’s doing is beneficial for America and the world. We’re done with perpetual war and your bizarre woke nonsense. You lost—accept it and start figuring out how to gain support for 2028 because, honestly, the Democrats have no talent. The only one who seems somewhat genuine is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
73. trump needs money. musk needs more freedom to do as he pleases. This combination is so bad for not only the American people, but the world.
74. Read the comments, nobody’s agreeing with you. Most of us are here offering cheese with your wine.
75. MAGA
76. This is what America needed. Trump will drain the swamp
77. Hopefully Elon cuts the budget on alot of bullshit government spending!
78. Who Let the DOGE’s Out?
Who, who, who, who?
Elon and Vivek are 2 of the brightest in politics. I am so ready to get rid of studying butterflies in Europe., or monkeys on meth. There will be plenty more to complain about than volunteers saving taxpayer money.
79. Watch the Democrats fight for higher taxes, as the government wastes taxpayer dollars.
In one year alone, the government lost $500 billion taxpayer dollars because of fraud, and we are responsible for that.
The taxpayers could save $2 trillion  per year, just by cutting wasteful spending.
80. There should be an investigation on whether musks involvement in our government and its policies is legal or not. "Conflict of interest" seems to be a good place to start.
81. Omg.. Donald Trump... Donald Trump.. Donald Trump... why don't ya'll try to figure why Biden got 81M votes and W.hore bag got 10M less...
82. Im sure George Patton's family money influenced the government and government contracts during WWIi. The families money may have influenced moving up in ranks. Wink wink
83. They will all be in prison in six years
84. *CNN, we need your other "expert" opinion, Robert De NIRO*
85. This clip is very eye-opening. I hope Ronan Farrow  creates a documentary for us. I like and respect his work.
86. Hey ya'll!!!! Just wait until Trump helps change the law so Musk can be president for 8 years !!!!!! Hahahahha
87. Just like u, macka!!!!
88. Bash, "new billionaire besty," lol 
Someone is jealous.  Ok, we will be your friend too.
89. The real question is why they were investigating Elon at all.   The outgoing admin has very clearly used Gov't agencies to silence critics.   This is not free speech.   CNN is Clueless News Network.
90. donald trump phobia 👈👉CNN😜😜😜
91. Matt Gaetz for Attorney General! LET'S GO AFTER THE CRIMES WE KNOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COMMITTED!
92. awwww is this news station not going to report on the ridiculous federal spending in 2023 alone.  what a bunch if tools, cnn must go
93. Don't you guys have anything else to babble about, you know important things.
94. Did he (they?) just imply that the guy who figured out how to pluck a spaceship out of the sky is stupid? The cognitive dissonance is strong with this one.
95. Still preaching doom and gloom, you guys never learn it's not working. Thanks for helping Trump win. Please dont ever change.
96. Kennedy to be in charge Of the hhs that's the CDC and the FDA. 1.6 trillion budget. 83 thousand employees.
97. anyone with half a brain saw this coming. The crooks in office aren't gonna hold themselves accountable.
98. Cnn is talking about accountability.... please practice before preaching
99. History will remember the Biden Administration as the  dark time that Democrats didn't know what a woman was. How they allowed, even encouraged, men who "felt" like they were Women to enter womens bathrooms and compete against them in Sports‼️ How this insane decision caused some women to be injured and end up in wheelchairs and others were attacked in bathrooms.History will NEVER FORGET and WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK to the Democratic Party.
100. Trump won BIG & these idiots @ CNN are singing the same song. Lmfao   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! 
TRUMP 2024
101. SUCK IT LEFTIES. HAHHAHAHAH
102. CNN is dividing the country.
103. The club of the dictators, billionaires and elite (some people say deep state), are working on the new world order to gain power over the entire globe. I’m still wondering how stupid people are to vote for that.
104. Sneaky
105. Hmmm
106. You over spent $20 million after spending $1 billion and you are now concern with counting pennies?  Musk do your duty and cut 75% of governmental positions that are unnecessary and wasteful to the public.  Working for the government is going to have a totally different meaning from now on.  No longer a cushy job with great benefits.
107. Well done.
108. Poor Dana!! I can smell her bitterness from far away!! 😂😂😂😂
109. “Billionaire Besties” is that the rhetoric of a unbiased news agency?  I wonder why CNN is in financial trouble.
110. America's new co-kings: ELON and FELON
111. Hey geniuses!!!! Everyone watching and commenting is keeping CNN alive. Keep hating.  The man called his followers basement dwellers. Y’all are just proving him right. SMH
112. Bye big government. Release the Epstein and Diddy lists.
113. So glad to see Ronan Farrow here. He is one of the best journalists of this century.
114. Who Is this the he/ she ???
115. trump will soon tire of Elon’s help and toss him aside. Can you imagine those 2 egos in one room?
116. Elon should sue CNN for Donkey Bush accusing him of "done something to the algorithm". What is her source?
117. I mostly ecstatic that with Trump’s election, the Republic may just have a shot to be saved by these Leftist propagandists, but I must admit, it’s surely is sweet, if not, hilarious, to see these looms go off the deep end.  Bye-bye, Pravda.
118. Great news about CNN laying staff off
119. CNN the activist group against America?
120. CNN and musk
121. I'm a registered Democrat but I'm curious why all of these people in government are afraid of the American people learning what they've been doing. Hmm. Why are they so scared of scrutiny?
122. Investigators have never themselves been investigated. Let's see what they've been up to
123. Jack Smith and lying CNN better lawyer up. Retribution is coming soon.
124. Speaking of cutting budgets, I hear CNN will be firing most of their political activists that play a "journalist" on TV.
125. Trump won, get over it!
126. Is CNN Staff afraid that the new D.O.J. will investigate them for Election Interference?
When you Get Charged with it, you should Argue this, *"If We Were Influencing the Election, How Come We Lost?"*
I Think a Jury would Buy That Story. Most of the Jurors would probably Watch CNN and Want to Let You Out of It.
I would Find You Not Guilty because I Don't Want to Ruin Your Lives. I Just Want to Watch you SQUIRM! That's Fun.
127. If Elon doesn’t his new BFF will.
128. Now CNN means to me the democratic party media operatives..specially this lady....I do not believe anything they say....spin..spin..of first to manipulate...
129. if there is someone you want running something it is elon musk.. and something i know for sure, he is not driven by greed
130. Keep these billionaire lunatics out of office!!!
131. What a Great Idea. Defund the Criminals who are Abusing their Power and Harassing Everyone.
That's All the FBI Does is Harass Citizens. They Haven't Done ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT in Years.
I wouldn't Be Surprised if NONE OF THEM Had a Background in Law Enforcement. They are Most
Likely DEI  Hires who Haven't Any Clue what a Real Crime is. Just get RID of the FBI! They're Useless.
132. CNN personalities....start looking for new jobs...maybe you can start your own podcasts, they are more relevant than you are now.Maybe Fox or News Nation will hire you.....
133. 😂😂 the senate has warned the DOJ to NOT destroy any documents related to the Jack Smith investigation of President Trump!
134. Why no discussion of fact that EM (& the other one) can slash all they want, but it boils down to paper recommendations?  Congress has to act & knowing its members, expect many to protect pet agencies/programs.
135. Comedy!!! After the Joey Cannibals Biden Administration Greatest Comedy Show in the history of mankind,  us humans need Comedy!! Comedy News Network is it!! Better than SNL!!!😂😂🤭🤡🥓❤️❤️
Bacon and eggs for breakfast!😊
136. Why would anyone care what an actress' kid thinks?
137. Want some really, really good news???  Cnn viewership is down 94% since 2016😊...Msdnc is down 54% in past week😊.. Life is good😊
138. The Democrats paid money for Hollywood actors this election instead of paying for BLM protestors and fringe actors Jussie Smollet.
139. CNN finally you're doing your job and investigating these corrupt assholes. I've given up on Trump supporters they're too stupid to realize corruption when they see it because their brainwashed however everybody else needs to be informed about this
140. 100% hate watchers... 
0% fans. Bye CNN.
141. He really doesn't need to, to be honest.  🤣
142. STFU you're over.
143. So let me get this straight conservatives don't like the Rich elite yet They want to put a bunch of corporate super elitist people and charge of the budget in our country....... Conservatives there's no way you guys can be that goddamn stupid
144. “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”
145. I am surprise they haven't blame the Russians for their landslide defeat in this election 😂😂
146. This is hilarious. I can't figure out who's supposed to be scared. But it's painfully obvious they're trying to make someone afraid. Just can't figure out who? Nobody cares if Musk and Trump are co-presidents.
147. You jave to admit how funny it is that cnn just continues to go down with the shinking ship. You take on elon musk and joe rogan and you think therea a positive to that?? The richest man and the most listened to pod caster.....please please keep it up cnn. 2028 will be a even bigger win. 

And still talking about far right extremism when the majority spoke thats what america is.....
148. Ok  Maga Dana Bash that your  party that  you are asking questions about? Why don't you ask the president elect you did everything to get him elected.
149. How bad was it under Biden and Harris? CNN report (11/14/24) says a typical family is spending another $1,148 A MONTH to afford what they did when Biden-Harris took office in 2021! Blame 40-year high inflation triggered by their out-of-control borrowing and spending! To buy a house in 2019, you had to have an income of $56,000. Today it’s $107,000! THEY HAVE MADE LIFE UNAFFORDABLE! NO WONDER THE VOTERS TOSSED THEM OUT!
150. Well cnn I give you credit to stop lying to the snowflakes 😂 msnbc will go broke fast they never learn that the American people will not let democrats ever run America again your pedo’s liars thieves traitors racists and cowards
151. This Woman is the Devil.
152. We love Elon! What a great choice. CNN is completely irrelevant
153. It doesn’t pose a high risk of corruption.  The corruption is the objective.
154. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
155. Down with cnn and fox give us news not your agenda
156. With all the promises from the campaign the debt will grow to new heights.
157. This guy knows nothing, all he can talk about is how to get people against Elon. When he wants to help the inflation so we can have a good economy again. Why do you guys hate our lively hood and economy being good. It will benefit everyone.
158. Man has anyone ever heard of the mainstream media breaking down every cabinet pick a president makes before???? This is just plain weird. Who cares cnn?? America voted for this......
159. Morgan bailed out the government you ninnies.
160. The Justice dept should investigate George Soros. That's a billionaire that needs investigating. George Soros is an enemy of the United States. Investigate him.
161. Thank You CNN and MSNBC for driving your viewers to vote for Trump.

MAGA STEADY
162. Ronan Farrow's audio is bad
163. Can’t think of a time when we’ve needed Ronan Farrow more than now. Him & all journalists- we need you more than ever.
164. Why aren’t you guys being honest on real issues that the federal government is using our tax dollars on. This is the reason why we dont trust you anymore!!
165. Dana you just won't stop with your bullcrap lies, can't you just throwout one compliment to President Trump from trying to clean out the waste to us taxpayers?
That fact that Elon and Viveck are doing the cleanup of waste in our government at no cost should even be questioned as this is something every taxpayer wants.
I'm thinking even you as a taxpayer would welcome with open arms.
166. Good! We want him to make those recommendations
167. Investigate CNN 1st and foremost
168. Good
169. Two sore losers on this show. Bash ready to cry😂😂😂😂😂
170. Trump's a convicted felon with a sweet immunity deal from the Supreme Court. What in his administration could possibly go awry?🙄🙄🙄
171. CNN sounds like a jealous ex girlfriend 😂
172. Brilliante young man...RONAN
173. Matt Gaetz says in House hearings against present A.G.  --- Sir I can read your Mind & this or that is what you think, and this is what you are aware of.  And now let me 

tell you I know what  you wouldn't yourself do, but I do know what books you have read.  Also do you know where my Aunt had dinner 9 weeks ago?  And shut up, no OR
Yes?  Why is it U do not know that, and reply to the words I put in your mouth.  Why do you deny what I say you think, Why are U ignoring my "If,"s Questions too?
174. 🤡🤡🤡
175. Matt Gaetz Drills current A.G. on House hearings.  But Essentially all his clips go to an equal Question.  Sir - isn't true that some Dishwashers knew the 

Kitchen Staff?  And Eventually became Cooks?  And can you explain why the Law is ignored & some Cooks later married a waitress, or why other Cooks 
went on to become a Franchise Restaurant Owner, instead of switching to Car dealerships?  Sir why do U allow this?  Never mind, I don't want to hear it!
176. I have big Respect for Ronan Farrow. Thank you for inviting him.
177. It's a bit ironic. How do you have a billionaire who is wealthy because he's taken all of this money away from other working people, yet he is hailed as the saviour OF THEM. How is he anti establishment when he is the biggest establishment there is  lol
178. Cry me a river, they are complaining they can't control Elon. You want a Starlink like communication device? Then buid one the military gets a budget of a trillion dollars or is that not enough?
179. The bots are at it again today!
180. CNN is upset because the abused said enough. Democrats hurt so many communities.
181. Elon Musk don't need to be Hanging around the White House over among the American citizens He's not for the American people he is for him self to gain Intelligence from the Government Elon Musk and Trump had a communicate with Russia Putin Elon musk Needs to stay out of USA government Business.
182. Good! I hope he defunds them. The democrats wasted countless millions investigating Trump. Adam Schiff created the Russian Hoax... he should be in jail.
183. I admire Elon Musk. He called out the overtly racist anti-White/ anti-Whiteness agenda and movement peddled by other affluent Americans. Democrats their supporters aligned with folks promoting anti-White racism, anti-Whiteness, and other radical left wing idiocy. The overtly racist anti-White/ anti-Whiteness agenda peddled by the US elite has caused me serious harm. 

And I am not at all suggesting that the US elite has advanced Black and brown Americans at the expense of White guys, like me. On the contrary, the US elite actually managed to vilify, scapegoat and discriminate against highly educated, skilled and talented White guys, like me, without rewarding the excellence of highly educated, skilled and talented Black and brown Americans. The folks truly benefiting from my being discriminated against are disproprtionately talentless and otherwise mediocre White persons from affluent families, persons with great political connections and/ or career connections.

Because I am a White guy from a family lacking political connections and/ or great career connections, I am denied any and all employment opportunities in Corporate America and on Wall Street. Meanwhile,  Hunter Biden made millions of dollars doing what I trained to do, without needing any of my years of professional training in matters related to International Business Management and Consultation. Affluent White guys with great career connections get to run Disney. And those affluent White guys actively promote the anti-White/ anti-Whiteness agenda and movement. And Disney management discriminates against White guys lacking the poilitical connections/ career connections of affluent White Americans. What those affluent White guys running dDisney don't do is actually advance the best interests of Disney or Disney shareholders.
184. Rubbish .
185. CNN = 🤡
186. Leave Elon alone.  Your bashing him is not going to entice ANY viewers to your dying news network.
187. CNN went after Elon now . We'll see .
188. Bye bye CNN !!  ADIOS con sus amigos libtards!
189. Where’s Clownmalas Billions of dollars since we’re talking money now ???🤡🤡 Radical media is powerless 😎🇺🇸
190. Fact is without cutting the regulations holding him back. The sun is expanding!. Slowly the planet went from snowball earth. To earth overerheating. Its not just carbon emissions.  Its the planet's rising vibration in total.  Being Slowly microwaved by our sun!!! No matter what the goldilocks position is changing!  Mars offers a (new earth). Getting there in 100 years is punitive to human development.  Here is already in a mass extension event!
191. Thank you  CNN for helping elect president Trump!!
192. Why is he being investigated? Because of political bias? The government employees should all have to justify having a job. They need head hunters to do job analysis and production valuations for all of them.
193. Cut the wasteful spending. Trim the fat.  This is American taxpayer money.   Idiots.
194. American vagabonds are back in power.
195. warms my heart to see such negative comments about CNN. get lost propaganda network we hate you. oh and by the way you lost
196. wait...who is investigating Elon and why? 🤣
197. Cnn.  Could you just turn comments off already.  You already let Russian and Chinese bots help Trump win

Now they're just annoying and superfluous.  Just get rid of em'
198. Is that dude wearing lipstick ? For real?😅
199. Rasputin shares similarities with Musk.
200. The on air talent needs to confess what management made them say and do. Think there is going to be a mountain of regret coming down the tracks for America ... CNN helped bring it on.
201. ELON MUSK IS SO RICH HE EVEN BOUGHT A WANNABE PRESIDENT TO BE HIS USEFUL IDIOT 😂😂😂
202. He’s presenting Elon as an idiot. His days of dreaming about being an influential journalist are disappearing.
203. It seems like most Republicans simply won't listen when Trump is criticized. Like a mother who refuses to acknowledge that her son is out of control.

*"Ma'am, we have several eye witnesses who claim that your son set fire to a school restroom."*

-- They are lying! My little Donnie would never do that. He's such a sweet boy!

*"Three girls have also stated that your son groped them as they were trying to exit the restroom."*

-- I'm sure he was just trying to protect them from the fire, sir. He's a very loving boy.
204. Elon can recuse himself and let Vivek handle those situations.
205. Conflict of interests
206. Stop interfering with what the voters voted for Cnn!
207. Is this lady real? Seems like a robot. Wait, she’s programmed to smile once in a while. That’s good.
208. Maga deplorables just trolling CNN video message boards.  Is your life that pathetic that you’re visiting us or is your brain washing on Fox entertainment over for the day?
209. America is so fucked
210. CNN failing is unstoppable.
211. I love when CNN and their viewers cry!!!!!! lmao
212. Is Elon Musk a citizen? Thought he lives in South Africa
213. She and he are obviously not in the loop about understanding the feedback from the shift phase from the old days of politics to the new direction that is unstoppable.
214. Anyone seen the photo floating around with diaper man on all four with putin holding the leash. Tell you all you need to know.
215. Elon knows how to cut costs to the bone.  He will turn the executive branch into a profit making startup only one third the size it is now.  When you think about it, why isn't every freeway a tollway.  Why not allow companies to drill, dig, burn or dump where ever they want? The government can make a profit on user fees. 
 Of course,  just like Elon has said, those families that don't make 6 figures are going to feel the painful contractions of service for awhile. But someday America will be truly great for extremely rich people.
216. I’m watching on TV now. These people have not learned anything. You lost CNN, enough of the Trump bashing.
217. LOOK EVERYBODY ..... ITS THE FAKE NEWS SHOW THAT CRIED WOLF !!!
218. not to mention his “AI is a threat to humanity” that needs to be regulated. A way to cut out competition is by govt control
219. Elon Musk should be stripped of all his assets and deported to South Africa.
220. oh Ronan, is that all you got? Going on CNN is a good way to lose your career!
221. Trump won and nothing you can do about it.
222. Or you
223. ITs a Red Wave, so they are going to do a lot of extreme things. But heres the fact: The gutting of the US federal services is a blatant attempt to stop regulation and investigation. They want to cut 2 trillion or more, yet even if you fired the entire US federal government you would hit that number.
Furthermore, agencies like the FDA are already understaffed and dont handle their workload. We have something like 3 agents in each state handling thousands of cases, and they want to cut things...
Things like talking about ending the FBI are absolutely horrific. The FBI does an AMAZING amount of things for American people and the world. THE ONLY people who beneift from it being gone are organized crime and criminals.
Furthermore, the idea you could replace them by making the FBI merge into another service like the NSA, DHS, or CIA makes that agency not just an intelligence agency, but the equivalent of the KGB. With the powers of arrest and espionage used on the American people just like they do in Hungary, Honduras, Brazil, Russia, China, and Belarus. Match that with any kind of dialogue about removal of the 22nd amendment, and you have a full on Belarus situation going on.

This is going to be the single largest predatory grift of our tax dollars into the hands of private government persons in the history of the world, all in the name of mimicking the same exact implementations that Lukashenka did in Belarus. Already apparent by the overhauls and selections of the cabinet in the past 72 hours.
Its not a doomsday theory here. Its a flat out over reach of the executive branch. They are using your apathy and fear to remove the power of the people from the House and Senate and limiting it to oversight. While simultaneously removing oversight and federal regulation agencies, and extending the powers of selections for powerful positions to the recommendations of private sector boards. While the judicial branch writes into law you CANNOT prosecute a President. You all need to be making phone calls and telling your House and Senate members what not to do. Put them on a leash. Things can ALWAYS get worse people. I did 10 years in the ME as a Marine, and 13 more as a PMC in 2nd and 3rd world countries. Trust me, YOU CAN lose your freedoms. 
If they try to remove the 22nd amendment, you all better be ready to stand up officially against it, because if they even try to remove it you have to fight. If they do remove it, we ill become a dictatorship that moment it is removed- and they will have the greatest and most powerful military and intelligence services to roam the planet on their side to stop you from taking any power back ever.
224. Watching the death spiral of cnn and msnbc post election has been glorious.  They went all in on the kamala glaze and destroyed the little bit of credibility they had left in the process 😂
225. Musk has NO business in our government!  How can this be allow way to may conflicts of interest
226. Trump is suing CBS for 10 million. 

MAGA
227. You messed around and found out.  😂😂
228. I would like to thank CNN, and MSDNC for their TDS and nonsensical ideology like identity politics for getting Trump back in the WH. Y'all are literally sitting in a burning sinking ship telling everyone that everything is perfectly fine.
229. I see CNN is again using their flying monkeys to attack Trump, his cabinet and the 75+ million who voted for him.
230. Farrow hasn't got a clue what he's talking about. Elon will certainly NOT have oversight over ant agency or department. He will simply investigate these agencies and departments for wasteful spending or incompetency
231. Kara Swisher says that Trump and Musk will clash and fall out before long, and I'm sure she's right.  The two most egomaniacal and narcissistic men in the world can't stay buddies for long.  I hope the breakup will happen sooner rather than later.
232. Government was established to Protect the Rights of the People. Period. Full Stop. 
Not to "go after" citizens who've achieved success with their businesses.
233. Elon is a very brilliant man. Build a bridge and get over it. Dana you could get those government contracts if you were that smart.......
234. The real election shocker wasn't Harris' loss. It was the defeat of San Fran's mayor and city attorney and LA's city attorney due to their soft on crime, no bail insanity. They were replaced by conservatives. The social experiments failed, and citizens want a return to safety and sanity.
235. Shame, I feel so so so sorry for you poor idiots
236. *CNN getting desperate.*
237. I remember when democrats were the party of electric cars, space exploration, and protecting the 1st amendment. Now they are the opposite
238. Spreading fake news!!!
239. Funny how the CNN talking heads left out the Soros influence on the Democrat party.
240. But I never thought the leopard would eat MY face.
241. What a horrible person Elon is...giving internet access to people at war or in disatrers, saving astronauts, building electric cars, free speach. websites. He's a evil vilian, must destroy cause this dweeb says so.
242. This type of baseless accusation is why Bash's job is on the cutting board.
243. CNN is picking on the most successful African American person in history, RACIST.
244. Ronan Farrow and his unbiased left wing hit pieces.  CNN stooping to new lows having this guy on the network.
245. Follow the money, always.
246. Why can't you be impartial dana. Your reports are always hateful towards people you don't like
247. As a European observer, it’s striking how Trump’s 2024 appointments follow the classic playbook of authoritarian regimes, both past and present. By placing loyalty and ideology over expertise, he has filled key roles with figures whose primary qualification seems to be their unwavering allegiance rather than their experience.

For instance, Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, despite prior legal controversies, and Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, lacking military leadership experience, echo the tactics of leaders like Mussolini and Putin, who also fortified their power with controversial loyalists. Similarly, Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence, known for questionable foreign ties, and the involvement of business figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the "Department of Government Efficiency" with limited public oversight, reflect patterns seen in Stalin's Soviet Union, as well as in contemporary Russia and Turkey. In these systems, loyalty becomes the linchpin for controlling institutions and weakening democratic checks – a model Trump now appears to be emulating.
248. Fake woman a men....
249. January 20th America can finally flush the Democraps down the toilet once and for all...
250. Good. Elon Musk. You are a mess...
251. Ronan Farrow is woody allen's son.   He publicly identified as part of the LGBT community in 2018.
252. The press having accountability what an absolute joke. Where was your accountability when we had a senile president matter fact we still have a senile president for the next two months. Where was your accountability when the president‘s son was cutting deals with world leaders? Where was your accountability during the entire Joe Biden administration
1 inflation you ignored it
2 Afghanistan, withdraw you made excuses for Biden
3 Biden’s prosecution of his political opponents you ignored it 
4 the Department of justice going after parents at school boards you blamed the citizens. 
5 Kamala Harris‘s horrible campaign you were an absolute denial
Accountability is coming for press. The markets will determine your fate.
PS I know you all love PBS NPR guess what Elon Musk is probably going to eliminate government subsidies for these beloved precious liberal networks icing on the cake, baby.
253. His father was Woody Allen? Mom Ma Farrow. Crazy times back then!
254. Ummm Bill Gates, Soros…etc
255. Soros?
256. CNN is a floating island of garbage
257. So if I get this right, Trump's not the threat to democracy anymore, now it's Elon. Can you clowns never learn?
Elon is bringing the future to us in our lifetime, because our bureaucratic red taped government can't get its head out of its own rear end. I grew up in the 70s and 80s when anything was possible, but we've yet to make 1 oz of progress since 1973. What a freaking disappointment! Let Elon do his thing and we won't just be great again, we'll evolve.
258. June to be re dedicated to FAMILY APPRECIATION  MONTH !!! 🥳🥳🥳
259. The beginning of the end for the USA as we know it. Here comes the next economic and societal collapse of a civilization.
260. How are the layoffs going low-ratings CNN?  😂😂😂😂😂
261. Hahahahahahaha!!!!
Cry more!
262. Trump gets away with everything.  He'll be gone for good in 4 years so the Dems need to stop crying and focus on running the country better and having a clear message for all Americans.  Trump had a clear message and the Dems didn't that why they lost.
263. Third world style goverment
264. Talk about buying your way into the government.....
265. Trump won and nothing you can say or do that'll change Americans minds.
266. Musk ❤
267. A monster has joined with another, leaving the entire world at risk.
268. Let's be honest, it doesn't matter who Trump appointed for any position, the liberal media would be screaming about it. However, Biden appoints a man in a dress that steal luggage at the airport, crickets.
269. Too late. The vendetta starts in January, the markets will see the chaos of Elon Muskovite controlling the agencies investigating him and the total SNAFU m, and will lose confidence in our law and order system. The slump will follow. I am practicing we TOLD YOU SO . 40 close Trump advisors told us. And we could see it. He told us about his revenge…
270. But, it was OK for the feds to have "influence" FaceBook and Twitter?  (That's fascism.)
271. 'besties' 'attached at the hip' enjoy the digs while you still have a job.
272. Now the woke doctrinated dems are still teasing. They can't stop. Don't they understand that they are de-feathered and served for the barbecue?!
273. CNN is nothing more than a dancing monkey for the Democratic organ grinders. The network is a joke.
274. Now CNN will target Elon Musk for the next 4 years.
275. Elon Musk has become Trump's new boyfriend and now Putin's jealous so he puts out nude photos of his wife Melania and made  some other threats!!! 🤔
276. Elon wants THINGS to go his way😊 American Greed🎉
277. Or Zuckerberg
278. Why didn't Trump vow to 'drain the swamp' this time? Coz the swamp just got a lot swampier!
279. Don’t look into his eyes lady 😱
280. New WH moto: "Say one thing - do the opposite"
281. The irony of the Elon power gifting approved by the same people who go off on the idea of Soros, Bilderberg among others influence.  But then logic is not their superpower then is it?
282. ELON is successful  ,true. In the Global  business  world. But he has NO Right to  touch a American  Government  Agency. Especially  as he DOES have Government  contracts.
283. Prepare for EJs bot to spam the comments section again
284. CNN host just doesn’t learn their lesson Besties are you talking about George Soros?
And Bill Gates besties of the Democratic Party
285. Like that didn’t happen already.

Are reports true that George Clooney’s phone call was a catalyst for Biden going??
286. Big shout out to trumpets for their comments. Helps with the algorithm. 👍
287. When Democrats controlled Facebook, YouTube and Google; CNN had no problem with that.
288. Billionaire was a democrant,now cnn is ,,,,,😂😂😂😂😂
289. There’s a tear in my beer….
290. You are the party who wants to curb speech and demands citizens to TOW THE LINE. So a citizen can't criticize FEMA response?It's now been proven a FEMA official favored non-Trump supporters... How many more?
291. Ohh it’s ok for Soros and whole Hollywood supporting Kamala but not Elon to support Republicans? #hypocrites
292. CNN all mad Elon brought back free speech to Twitter.
293. CNN HAS NO CREDIBILITY!  BLATANTLY LYING ABOUT TRUMP IS TAKING ITS TOLL AND NOW THEY WANT TO ATTACK ELON AND THERE WONDERING WHY THERE RATING ARE FALLING LOL
294. He’s the secret son of Frank Sinatra
295. This is probably true, wonder who can afford him ? And Trump too, I mean they're just billionaires ? They can both be easily bought out 😂
296. Who could have thought America would  become a crony capitalist kleptocracy.
297. Farrow is an idiot....  so sad how so many people who aren't qualified are speaking on CNN?  Deaths from self driving?  Would you rather have some dumbass driving while they're texting or have a driver that has cameras on all sides of the car & doesn't rely on all the distracted drivers on the road?  It's a no brainer & any intelligent person knows that assisted driving & self driving will save millions of lives.  Who is Farrow's Uncle that works with CNN?  How do these idiots get these jobs?
298. Elon is passionate about getting our country working efficiently. WHAT AN AMAZING MAN! THANK YOU ELON
299. Does cnn and it's viewers have a problem defining a CRIMINAL?

If you love the South American criminals so much, why don't YOU look after them in your homes and/or neighborhood's
300. I support Elon musk
301. Why did they weaponize justice to go after him? Because he doesn't hire illegals why because his shit it top secret and by law he can't. Because he was against the elitist they prioritized going after Musk. Americans saw it,  we didn't like & we voted. #saltytears
302. We love Trump ❤️
303. Im so glad you guys are doing all this on video. Lol.  We see you. 
Pray for the left they believed the lies we didn't Much love to all Patriots God bless 🙏🎉🇺🇸
304. Elon has provided more rural internet than the Government has and it cost a fraction. Pete Buttigieg wasted $30B to only build 8 EV Charging Stations. You don't want to talk about THAT? Journalists, you have been gaslighting the American people. Much of this election result is also a backlash of your INABILITY to demand politicians TO FIX THINGS. Instead, you attack the messenger. LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS they are highlighting. At this rate, you will lose more elections.
305. CNN is burnt toast, DONE!!!
306. The Mickey Mouse Club will have a short shelf life. The worm will turn & Trump will turn on the Musk Rat. Inevitable.
307. Been saying it for years, beware of Musk’s monopolistic agenda!
308. He’s hoping dj6 is his “long lasting relationship that will make him happy”
I predict another failed relationship
309. Oh gosh...
310. CNN believes in too much of what if scenarios.
311. Cnn has lost their collective minds!  They all fear Musk!  Time to drain the swamp and by the way - who is this Farrow clown??
312. Musk's made up position has no power to actually do anything at all. He is simply a lobbyist paid with our tax dollars. That's not to say he won't push for those budget cuts, but he will have to depend on others to actually do it for him.
313. The man is a success in everything he does. Isn’t government efficiency what we should all want? A balanced budget?
314. Looking forward to four great years with trump. 🎉❤😊
315. God Bless Elon Musk, God Bless President Trump Hope they get together more often, they represent the genius dio of America, look around you every body is happy Hay! Biden is gone forever! Hay!
316. Cut and save  the money to go to the Mars 🚀
317. Why does Nepobaby have a say? And Elon doesn't? Let the adults finish their job to cut the fat. Hey Ronan, CA Audit says Billions of Homeless spending is Untraceable and Untrackable.. with NO POSITIVE OUTCOMES.Why is this the status quo? It is BY DESIGN..
318. He has no guilty
319. Democrats brought all this on themselves with their lawfare etc. Its opened the door for all of this stuff.
320. Check's and balance's CNN? Lol you made sure that ship sunk before it hit the dock CNN. You failed as the 4 th Estate and now you will reap the whirlwind you created  for yourself and the innocent.
321. Apparently Dems had no problem with Biden "cozying up" to China, Russia and Ukraine as he enriched himself to the tune of millions with pay to play schemes via his drug addict son Hunter. Other than that they are just salty that Tulsy, along with many other high profile Dems, are jumping ship and joining Trump's America First movement as they try to figure out how to deal with the radical left terrorist supporters within their party along with all of their unpopular policies that cost them the election.
322. mother  earth  save  us  from  all  those  crazy people  .......russia  now  usa   is  that some  mushrooms  in  the  air.........
😰😥😨😭😱👾👾👾👾
323. Elon Musk could potentially cut the budgets of agencies investigating him ？？
No~~~~
You don't know Elon Musk at all .
He will cut the all agencies ！！！
324. Big fan of Ronan's reporting and precision with language.
325. THIS IS EXACTLY what Americans voted for!! Criminals in power!! YOU`VE GOTTA LiVE WITH IT!! LOVE from Europe
326. Billionaires brought the white house; this is what they voted for
327. Good, it was probably Trumped up investigations anyway, the Dems know no bounds
328. Ronan is right. 

Musk and friend.

Will function as private inspectors. 
Move on with Project 
Or closings if they don't agree. 

A made Up Section of government.
329. The democrats and their corrupt leftist judges and prosecutors are sinking in their own  defecation . Get used to tasting your own medicine.
330. Should govt spending and govt contracts be cut while some departments be reformed.  Yes, no doubt. But with a scalpel and percision. I can just see elon pacing with his flame thrower waiting till jan. 20th.  Buddy does not have the mental patience to work anywhere near government oversight.
331. So stupid!  Elon has already said he’s going to crash the market and Americans will suffer.  Elon is also very well connected to China.  Between Trump and China, he’ll do whatever whenever he wants.  He’s perfectly set up to profit massively in the new US autocracy.
332. you guys are losing ratings by the minute.
333. Democrats lost everything ❤🎉 cope and understand a majority of Americans think you are out of touch
334. The people that are saying all Trumps picks are bad are the same ones that said Joe's sharp as a tack, and Kamala is qualified to be President without a vote
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
335. Trump and Musk here to put a Stop to Woke Stupidity 

Get tf out 👉🏼
336. Investigating him for what?  Voting Republican?
337. Is this a woman or a.....????
338. WHINY DEMOCRATS have controlled the system for decades and fleeced the American people.  ITs time to PAY THE PIPER dems
339. Pravda gonna Pravda
340. Oh now it makes sense - just like Trump previous cabinet- fraudsters to the count of 7
341. Typical CNN  "what if"  propaganda,  No credibility, no integrity,  NO TRUTH here
342. Muck = Rasputin.
343. Where is the accountability from the Democrats and legacy media and shills like Dana Bash on the $1B used to pay for propaganda from celebrities from those of us who contributed small sums to get out the vote! I am done with the Democrats.
344. Just another reason to appreciate Elon
345. Can you guys cry some for my new documentary.... liberal lies
346. He'll save on the lawyers he currently pays to keep investigators of his behaviours at bay now so of course he'll do it.
347. More Bond Villain than Marvel Avenger.
348. Some believe Musk influenced the outcome in swing states with his technology and then you have the President of Turkey telling Trump its in the bag. Who knows the truth.
349. We are fixing the pants and throwing out the belt of woke stupidity
350. 😱🕳️🖤 surprised 😯 CNN on the Air, amazing working for min wage 🤯🤯🤯🤯
351. CNN is hopeless... so out of touch
352. Liberal Tears are good Merry Christmas to MAGA 😂
353. All the Frendo Agencies better be Cut at 90%....keep it up Musk...
354. Thank god for Elon 🫡
355. Good👍 tired of our taxes being spent by the tens of millions of dollars just to put political pressure on innocent people thru frivolous investigations
356. Dana Bash isn't doing to good nowadays 🤣
357. How does CNN still exist???.. how does anyone actually believe anything this network reports?...
358. We are going to investigate you liberals for 100 yrs 😁
359. *AS THE VOTES CONTINUE TO BE COUNTED... TRUMP'S PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULAR VOTE IS SLOWLY DROPPING, DOWN TO 50.2% NOW,*
*TO KAMALA'S CURRENT 48.2%.*
*THAT ISN'T MUCH OF A "LANDSLIDE" OR "MANDATE" ............ HE COULD END UP BEING BELOW 50% WHEN THIS IS FINALLY OVER.*
360. Lmao cry more
361. Daca il scapa din ochii il perde pe Donald Trump..... Elon musk 😂😂😂😂
362. Getting ready to get real jobs Dei and woke bullshit is gone
363. Defense contractor with security clearance.  "Joined at the hip" to the W.H. perfectly fine! 😂
364. There is absolutely nothing sweeter than CNN tears
365. You mean your sad that you can’t weaponize the government against people you disagree with anymore? Lol
366. Elon launches rockets way cheaper than NASA can and the saves the taxpayers millions.
367. MAGA rules America and you liberals live by our rules now 😂
368. Stupid dana bash trying to disrespect people who just won the election.
369. Sinatras son 😂
370. Just as the world stood against Nazism and the Holocaust, the world must stand against Israel and the Holocaust in Gaza.
371. Ronan Farrow could potentiakly be a serial killer.
372. Markets don’t like Total madness !! This is the beginning of the end? Once the world perceives there is a pandemonium in the USA, the confidence is gone, dollar collapses… thanks to maga idiots. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do. The big money can take off, we are left holding the bag of 💩. Biden is still in office and he is sane. Once those incompetents bent on revenge take over, the vendetta starts. I will try to hedge my bets
373. elon can be arrested and deported . that is all he can do
374. CNN  you are a joke
375. Cnn will always fault everything related to Trump... This sickness is irreversible!
376. What sensitive information already have a satellite 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
377. The guy is seriously greedy for attention & power.
378. I demand a recount!
379. Elon has billions in government contracts talk about the Fox guarding the henhouse!
380. Elon saved free speech
381. Time to investigate the investigators. 🗽
382. MSNBC  & CNN Prime Time Viewership down 50% - Confirmed Worthless Like Biden, Kamala, and Democrats.
383. I don’t see any problem 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
384. Hopefully he does find 2 trillion to cut from the budget
